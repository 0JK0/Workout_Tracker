# Working Project 
It still lacks the deleting and auto updating history

### How to use?

  - Download the 4 files necessary for the program to work.
  - Execute the main.py file after downloading the required files.
  - The main classes are divided into separate modules for simplicity and organization.
  - The program is controlled through the "GUI" that appears in the terminal.
  - Be cautious as there are still many bugs that might appear if the inputs are not as expected.
  - The program attempts to create a new file locally for the database.
  - If the program cannot create a new file, it will break.
  - To prevent this, ensure you either execute it with Admin permissions or open all 4 files in VSCode and execute it from there.


## Description (repeated from the main README.md)

A Workout Tracking "app" run from the terminal, it should allow to view, update, and register the date of a routine.
How?

I'm planing to make it using SQLite and Python i don't want a GUI since apart from the fact i don't feel like learning how to make one, i just feel like is kinda cooler if it is used without a GUI
Using experience:

The way the user(me) is going to interact with the "app" should go something along the lines of:

    Ask for options (1.Show all available Routines 2.Show Workout History)

if option 1 is chosen:

    Display routines table

    Chose the routine to use

    display the table for that specific routine then ask (1.View 2.Use 3.Update)

        View mode: shows the table again

        Use mode: display 1 by 1 each workout (row), it will display a counter to count sets, after it reaches the amount of sets it will give a resting timer and move to the next workout(row). When it finishes it should display the amount of time taken and save: the routine done, the date and the time it took. In another table finally show the History table and ask if they want to (1.Quit 2.Go back to menu)

        Update mode: Allow to change amount of sets,reps or workouts in said routine then just go to view mode.

if option 2 is chosen:

    Show the History table and ask for (1.Quit 2. Go back to menu)
